Understanding Directory Structure in Linux
/ -> root directory or thetop level directory from where every other directory originates
/bin -> stores binaries and executables
/etc-> stores all system configuration files
/home -> home directory where you can store your pictures etc
/opt -> all third part softwares are installed in opt ( eg Splunk) 
/tmp -> temporray space ( gets cleared at boot time)
/usr -> user directory all user related programs . user can also have binaries for that user in /usr/bin
/var -> variable data ( eg log files /var /logs)
/boot -> files need to boot your OS lives here. This si where your linux kernal lives
/media -> location to access the files stored on usb/dvd media
/mnt -> to mount external files
/sbin -> system administration boundaries
/srv -> some linux distribution use /srv for data served  by linux server eg /srv/www -> webserver files /srv/ftp -> ftp files


Note -> some applications are installed in /usr/local or /opt directories
/usr/local/avast/bin

Basic Commands

File System Commands
In linux a folder is called a directory.

ls -> lists the contents of the directory
mkdir -> creates a directory
cd -> to move to a different directory
pwd -> tells you teh present working directory
cat -> lists the content of the file
vi -> is the editor to craete a new file

find -> it is used to find a file 

eg -> find -name password.txt
This will tell you where the password.txt is located

find -name *.txt 
this will list all the .txt files

wc -l access.log // it will give you the length of the file

grep "10.0.0.1" access.log // it will give you the line where the ip  is present in access.log


Operators in Linux

& // this helps you run commands in teh backgroud of the terminal 
&& //this combines multiple commands in 1 line
> //it is a redirection operator you can take the output of 1 command and redirect it anywhere
>> Same as redirection but it appends teh output rather than replacing it

& -> if you want to copy a big file that takes time use & operator to run it in background
&& -> command1 && command2  -> in this case command 2 will run only when command1 is successfull
echo hello > welcome -> it puts hello in welcome file
echo how are you >> welcome -> it appends how are you to a wlcome file which already had "hello"
