Operators in Linux

& // this helps you run commands in teh backgroud of the terminal 
&& //this combines multiple commands in 1 line
> //it is a redirection operator you can take the output of 1 command and redirect it anywhere
>> Same as redirection but it appends teh output rather than replacing it

& -> if you want to copy a big file that takes time use & operator to run it in background
&& -> command1 && command2  -> in this case command 2 will run only when command1 is successfull
